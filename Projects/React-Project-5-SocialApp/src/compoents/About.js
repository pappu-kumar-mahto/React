                Welcome to Social App, number one platform for all stuff going on day to day life. We're
                dedicated to giving you the very best platform so that you can freely share your thoughts and share your moments with your loved ones.
                Founded in 2022 by Pappu, SocalApp has come a long way from its beginnings in a
                home office, toolshed, Houston, TX. When Pappu first started out, his passion for
                helping other be more social-friendly, providing the best place for his fellow colleagues to post his/her experinces and share their feelings,
                drove him to do intense research, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and
                inspiration into to a booming social world. We now serve users all over place, the US, the world, the
                Austin area, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, social-friendly sector.
